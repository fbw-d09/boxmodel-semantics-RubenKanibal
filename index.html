                    <h3>Cute Tarantula Infos!</h3>
                    <p>Some infos about tarantulas:</p>
                    <p>
                        Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy
                        spiders of the family Theraphosidae. As of August 2022,
                        1,040 species have been identified, with 156 genera. The
                        term "tarantula" is usually used to describe members of
                        the family Theraphosidae, although many other members of
                        the same infraorder (Mygalomorphae) are commonly
                        referred to as "tarantulas" or "false tarantulas". Some
                        of the more common species have become popular in the
                        exotic pet trade. Many New World species kept as pets
                        have setae known as urticating hairs that can cause
                        irritation to the skin, and in extreme cases, cause
                        damage to the eyes.
